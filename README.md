# Black-Hole
Computer Graphic : 2nd Assignment

Actually our first draft was to build an illusion pic without any animation or movement but somehow we needed to make it move, so we had been discussed about something 
that seem similar to illusion pic and it was a black hole. ( if you find something ( or mechanic ) that similiar to black hole, our first draft and final draft might help. )
